[5:24 pm, 15/12/2025] Tulasi G H: # Hate Speech Detection on Social Media

## About Me
I completed my Master’s degree in Computer Science at the University of East London.
I passed with Distinction.

## Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting hate speech on social media using Machine Learning techniques implemented in MATLAB.

## Tools and Techniques
- MATLAB
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Naive Bayes Classifier
- Text Processing and Feature Extraction

## Description
The system analyses social media text data and classifies content as hate speech or non-hate speech.
This project was developed as part of my MSc Computer Science degree at the University of East London.

## 📖 Project Overview
This is my *Master's Dissertation* project from the *University of East London, implementing an automated hate speech detection system for social media using **MATLAB. The system classifies text into three categories: **hateful, **offensive, and **neutral*.

## 📊 Results (From My Dissertation)
| Model | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score | AUC-ROC |
|-------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|---------|
| *Support Vector Machine (SVM)* | *99.18%* | 0.986 | 1.000 | 0.993 | 1.000 |
| *Naive Bayes* | 50.14% | 0.877 | 0.459 | 0.602 | 0.573 |

*Key Findings:*
- SVM achieved *99.18% accuracy* with perfect recall (1.000) for hateful and offensive content
- Perfect AUC-ROC score of *1.000* demonstrating excellent class separation
- Naive Bayes struggled due to its independence assumption in natural language

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- *Programming Language:* MATLAB R2023b
- *Toolboxes:* Text Analytics Toolbox, Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox
- *Algorithms:* Linear SVM, Multinomial Naive Bayes
- *Feature Extraction:* TF-IDF, Bag-of-Words
- *Evaluation:* Confusion Matrix, ROC Curves, Precision-Recall, F1-Score
