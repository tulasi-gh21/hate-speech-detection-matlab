Hate Speech Detection on Social Media

## About Me
I completed my Master’s degree in Computer Science at the University of East London.
I passed with Distinction.

## Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting hate speech on social media using Machine Learning techniques implemented in MATLAB.

## Tools and Techniques
- MATLAB
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Naive Bayes Classifier
- Text Processing and Feature Extraction

## Description
